# 3D-Newtonian-Gravity-Simulation

Python 3D newtonian gravity simulation for n particles using matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, and numpy. This program is capable of accuracy up to the 4th order.

The motivation for creating this simulation is to refamiliarize myself with Python so I can tackle more difficult physical simulations. Moreover, this simulation acted as visual guidance for my own curiosity and research.
