# 3D-Newtonian-Gravity-Simulation

Python 3D newtonian gravity simulation for n particles using matplotlib, mpl_toolkits, numpy, and other libraries. This program is capable of running simulations of first, second, third, and fourth order accuracy (currently implementing second, third, and fourth).

The motivation for creating this simulation is to refamiliarize myself with Python so I can tackle more difficult physical simulations and other python projects. Moreover, I used this time to get acquainted with typical python libraries used in scientific computing.
